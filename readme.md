This repository contains the Python implementation of both lexical and syntax analyzers for our custom programming language, Gensai. The primary purpose of this project is to tokenize the contents of ".gsai" files using the lexical analyzer and subsequently pass these tokens to the syntax analyzer for further analysis. The syntax analyzer ensures the correctness of the program's structure.

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Syntax Analyzer by running the app.py or run_syntax.py
